\# ARC Network Swap \& Bridge - Project Summary



\## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive swap and bridge solution for the ARC network, demonstrating advanced understanding of ARC's unique architecture and Circle's ecosystem tools.



\## Key Accomplishments



\### Technical Implementation

\- Developed smart contracts for token swap and cross-chain bridge functionality

\- Created a complete web interface for user interaction

\- Implemented Circle Bridge Kit integration

\- Designed architecture compatible with ARC's USDC-native gas model



\### Documentation

\- Comprehensive technical documentation

\- Detailed explanation of ARC Network features

\- Innovation summary highlighting unique aspects

\- Development log tracking all activities



\### Architecture Components

\- \*\*Smart Contracts\*\*: SwapContract.sol and BridgeContract.sol

\- \*\*Backend\*\*: JavaScript implementation with Express.js server

\- \*\*Frontend\*\*: Complete web interface with intuitive UX

\- \*\*API Layer\*\*: REST endpoints for all core functionalities



\## Unique Value Propositions



\### For ARC Network
