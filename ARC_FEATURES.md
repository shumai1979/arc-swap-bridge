\# ARC Network Specific Features



\## Unique Characteristics



\### USDC as Native Gas Token

\- ARC uses USDC as its native gas token instead of a separate utility token

\- This provides predictable transaction costs insulated from crypto-market volatility

\- Fee-smoothing algorithm keeps dollar costs low even when the network is busy

\- Streamlined accounting and treasury workflows

\- Supports stablecoin finance with predictable economics



\### Stable Economics Model

\- Dollar-cost stability through USDC-based fees

\- Predictable transaction costs regardless of market conditions

\- Reduced volatility impact on transaction fees

\- Consistent economic model for developers and users



\## Technical Specifications



\### Circle Bridge Kit Integration

\- Full support for Circle's Bridge Kit

\- Built-in monetization support

\- Efficient cross-chain transfers

\- Secure token bridging between networks



\### Network Compatibility

\- Bridge support for Ethereum-Sepolia

\- Bridge support for Base-Sepolia

\- Bridge support for Arbitrum-Sepolia

\- Potential for additional networks



\## Development Advantages



\### For Developers

\- Familiar development experience with standard tools

\- Stable cost structure for application economics

\- Clear documentation and resources

\- Active community support



\### For Users

\- Predictable transaction fees

\- Stable token economics
